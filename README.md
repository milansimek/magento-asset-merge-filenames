# Magento JS / CSS merged filename contents hash
#### Makes Magento use the md5 hash of merged js / css contents as filename    
   
By default Magento uses the hash of the filenames of the individual JS / CSS files as the filename of the combined file.     

     
This module makes Magento use the md5 hash of the file contents instead, making the filename unique each time one of the combined files is changed.
